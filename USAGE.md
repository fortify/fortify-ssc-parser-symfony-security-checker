This Fortify SSC parser plugin allows for importing scan results from Symfony Security Checker.

### Deprecation notice

The Symfony/SensioLabs PHP Security Checker is no longer functional as stated at https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker#readme, and as such this parser plugin has been deprecated. 

At the time of writing the JSON output of the alternative [Local PHP Security Checker](https://github.com/fabpot/local-php-security-checker) is compatible with the Symfony Security Checker parser plugin, so existing users may consider sticking with this parser plugin to avoid having to re-audit their existing results. It is however strongly recommended to migrate to the new [Local PHP Security Checker parser plugin](https://github.com/fortify-ps/fortify-ssc-parser-php-security-checker).

Use the following steps to migrate from this parser plugin to the Local PHP Security Checker parser plugin:

1. Install and enable the Local PHP Security Checker parser plugin
2. Make sure your application version has no pending audit information
3. Download the application file for your application version
4. Make the following changes to the application file you just downloaded, using your favorite zip tool (the FPR file is just a zip file) and editor:
    * Inside the application file, rename `SYMFONY_SECCHECK.zip` to `PHP_SECCHECK.zip`
    * Inside `PHP_SECCHECK.zip`, update `scan.info` to show `engineType=PHP_SECCHECK` (instead of `engineType=SYMFONY_SECCHECK`)
    * Edit `audit.xml`, pre-pending a 'P' to all issue instance id's. For example, search for `instanceId="` and replace with `instanceId="P`
5. Upload the modified application file to SSC
6. Delete all previously uploaded SYMFONY_SECCHECK artifacts after verifying that the audit information has been successfully applied to the PHP_SECCHECK issues

## Plugin Installation

These sections describe how to install, upgrade and uninstall the parser plugin in SSC.

### Install & Upgrade

* Obtain the plugin binary jar file; either:
     * Download from the repository release page: https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-symfony-security-checker/releases
     * Build the plugin from source: https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-symfony-security-checker/CONTRIB.md
* If you already have another version of the plugin installed, first uninstall the previously  installed version of the plugin by following the steps under [Uninstall](#uninstall) below
* In Fortify Software Security Center:
	* Navigate to Administration->Plugins->Parsers
	* Click the `NEW` button
	* Accept the warning
	* Upload the plugin jar file
	* Enable the plugin by clicking the `ENABLE` button
  
### Uninstall

* In Fortify Software Security Center:
     * Navigate to Administration->Plugins->Parsers
     * Select the parser plugin that you want to uninstall
     * Click the `DISABLE` button
     * Click the `REMOVE` button 

## Obtain results


<!-- START-INCLUDE:parser-obtain-results.md -->

Please see the Symfony Security Checker documentation for details on checking applications and generating reports. Note that the SSC parser plugin requires the uploaded reports to be in JSON format.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:parser-obtain-results.md -->


## Upload results

Results can be uploaded through the SSC web interface, REST API, or SSC client utilities like FortifyClient or [fcli](https://github.com/fortify-ps/fcli). The SSC web interface, FortifyClient and most other Fortify clients require the raw results to be packaged into a zip-file; REST API and fcli allow for uploading raw results directly.

To upload results through the SSC web interface or most clients:

* Create a `scan.info` file containing a single line as follows:   
     `engineType=SYMFONY_SECCHECK`
* Create a zip file containing the following:
	* The scan.info file generated in the previous step
	* The raw results file as obtained from the target system (see [Obtain results](#obtain-results) section above)
* Upload the zip file generated in the previous step to SSC
	* Using any SSC client, for example FortifyClient or Maven plugin
	* Or using the SSC web interface
	* Similar to how you would upload an FPR file
	
Both SSC REST API and fcli provide options for specifying the engine type directly, and as such it is not necessary to package the raw results into a zip-file with accompanying `scan.info` file. For example, fcli allows for uploading raw scan results using a command like the following:

`fcli ssc artifact upload -f <raw-results-file> --appversion MyApp:MyVersion --engine-type SYMFONY_SECCHECK`
